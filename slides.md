# Introduce of ReinforceReinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is learning what to do—how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward signal.

**A complete, interactive goal-seeking agent, explores and learn from (unknown) enviorment.**

## Main subelements of RL system

- Policy: A **mapping** from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states.
- Reward: The **signal** that defines the goal of a reinforcement learning problem, indicates what is good in an immediate sense
- **Value function**: Specifies what is **good in the long run**. Action choices are made based on value judgments.
- Model of the environment: allows **inferences** to be made about how the environment will behave.
